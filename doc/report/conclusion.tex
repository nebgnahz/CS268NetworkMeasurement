\label{sec:conclusion}

We believe that our results are relevant in displaying the current state of latency in wide-area, data center, and mobile networks. It is our goal to continue collecting measurements and refine our methodologies. Our next step is to compare our wide-area latency results to existing datasets, such as iPlane. For our DC measurements, we plan on re-evaluating our querying strategy; we hope to develop a better method of generating query strings as well as a long term solution to overcoming the limit on query rate. Finally, we hope to expand our mobile network study by measuring full application layer tasks, such as HTTP requests.
