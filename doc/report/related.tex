% the following related works are more from end-host perspective.

In this section we will review the possible tools and methodologies that we hope will prove valuable for our projects.

There are a number of existing tools for Internet measurement; they primarily differ in the network characteristics they measure. To name a few, {\em ping} is the popular tool used to test reachability and measure round-trip time (RTT). {\em traceroute} \cite{jacobson1989traceroute} and {\em tcptraceroute} \cite{toren2001tcptraceroute} reveal the routing path as well as the RTT. King \cite{gummadi2002king} measures the end-to-end latency using recursive DNS queries. {\em pathchar} \cite{jacobson1997pathchar} measures the hop-by-hop bandwidth and \cite{jain2002pathload} reports the available bandwidth of a path. \cite{paxson2002experiences} provides dedicated hardware for measurements, only affiliated  users can access. Therefore in \cite{spring2003scriptroute}, Spring {\em et al.}\, seeks to build a generic platform for ordinary users to conduct measurements from remote vantage points.

On top of these tools, many large Internet monitoring projects (such as pingER \cite{matthews2000pinger}) have been built. Furthermore, researchers are also trying to infer Internet performance and security \cite{paxson1999bro} based on measurement results (\cite{downey1999using} utilized {\em pathchar} tool to estimate Internet link characteristics).

With the advent of cloud computing and mobile computing, it becomes important to characterize their performance. \cite{kandula2009nature, benson2010network} analyzes traffic patterns in data center, and \cite{huang2011mobiperf} is an ongoing project in measuring mobile end-host network performance.

Vern Paxson's work in \cite{paxson1997measurements, paxson1997end, paxson2004strategies} serves as guidelines in our design and implementation of all measurement experiements.
