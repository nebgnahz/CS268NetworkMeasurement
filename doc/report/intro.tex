\label{sec:introduction}
The primary goal of this project is not to introduce any new network measurement tools, but instead use existing measurement technique. The key results will be the characteristics of current Internet, including Cloud services and Mobile networks. We seek to answer the a series of questions concerning the performance of latest Internet.

This project will explore the latency between end hosts, including user interaction with cloud services, arbitrary websites, other end hosts. We are especially interested in mobile and wireless performance, and how current internet performance compares to the speed-of-light communication boundary. Furthermore, we intend to assess the relationship between latency and time on both daily (day vs evening) and weekly (weekday vs weekend) time scales.

This project will also explore how wide-area networks and datacenters contribute to end-to-end latency experienced by end users. Moreover, we will examine the behavior and E2E latency effects of edge caching of content, particularly on mobile networks. Finally, we will also consider detecting network bottlenecks and how they vary with time.

This project will primarily re-implement and recreate previous measurement work in the context of the current internet,  following the guidelines outlined in \cite{paxson2004strategies}. We intend to re-implement the DNS measurement strategy proposed in \cite{gummadi2002king} and explore additional strategies for measuring mobile end-host latency.
