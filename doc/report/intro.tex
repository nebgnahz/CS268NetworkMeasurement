\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

The measurement of Internet has become increasingly important and challenging due to its complexity, large-scale and variability, and numbers of tools have been proposed to achieve the task (see Sec.\,\ref{sec:related-work} for a complete review). While in this project, our primary goal is not to introduce any novel network measurement tool. Instead, we use existing measurement techniques to characterize the performance of current Internet. We base our work on previous investigations, and try to elucidate the changes ever since. Specifically, the cloud computing service model and mobile computing have shaped the Internet to an unanticipated way. And how the end-to-end latency has been changed is never formally studied by measurements. To motivate, we seek to answer a series of questions listed below.

\begin{itemize}
\item How the network latency varies among different kinds of end hosts -- generic end users(including mobile/wireless end hosts), regular web servers, and cloud service from data centers?
\item How current Internet latency performs in comparison to the speed-of-light limit?
\item How wide-area networks and data centers contribute to end-to-end latency experienced by end users?
\item How the latency is affected by edge caching of content, especially on mobile networks?
\item What's the characteristics of time-series analysis for latency on a daily/weekly/yearly basis?
\end{itemize}

Our initial approach will be re-implementing and re-producing previous measurement works in the context of current Internet, following the guidelines outlined in \cite{paxson2004strategies}. One major strategy we intend to re-implement is King \cite{gummadi2002king} that leverages the DNS infrastructure to measure end-to-end latency of arbitrary end hosts. To guarantee deliverables, we have a rough plan (see Table.\,\ref{tab:plan}).
