\label{sec:methodology}
In this section, we will fully describe our approaches in conducting these latency related measurements.

\subsection{Latency in WAN}
\label{sec:latency-wan}

\subsection{Latency for DC conversations}
\label{sec:latency-dc-conv}
Bearing in mind that the primary goal for this part is to understand the partition of latency from end-users' perspective, we designed the experiment to perform data center related tasks. As an representative user-facing service, we have chosen Google Search due to its wide adoption by the public. We expect the following model to be used in 

\subsection{Latency within the Cellular networks}
