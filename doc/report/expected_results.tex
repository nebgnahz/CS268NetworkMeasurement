\section{Expected Results}
\label{sec:results}

We expect to have results in the form of actual measurement tools and data, as well as analysis tools and reproducible analysis output. The dataset will consist of latency measurements between end hosts along with meta-data (the DNS query, Geo-IP resolution, time of testing, environment of testing, etc.). Our analysis will compare latency to time and physical location, and separate WAN latency from datacenter latency. Various visualization might be employed in assisting answering those questions in Sec.\,\ref{sec:introduction}.
